Titan Legends // $LGNDX - NFT/Token Hybrid

Titan Legends introduces a novel NFT // TOKEN Hybrid model through an innovative two-way escrow mechanism which solves the problem of liquidity in the NFT space. This innovative mechanism allows users to lock their Titan Legends NFTs in exchange for LegendX ($LGNDX) tokens and vice versa, successfully blending generative art NFTs with the liquidity of an ERC-20 token. This not only creates a hyper-deflationary NFT collection, but also supports deflation in the $LGNDX token as users interact with the system. 

LGNDX Token Overview:
2,888,888,888 TOTAL SUPPLY
$LGNDX/$DragonX Initial LP
0/0 TAX TOKEN
1% Max Wallet to be lifted approx. 30-60 mins post-launch.

TitanLegendsBattlefield.sol Overview:
The "Battlefield" is the escrow/staking contract for Titan Legends NFTs and $LGNDX token. Users have the option to lock their NFT in the smart contract and claim a "bounty" of a set amount of $LGNDX tokens per a points system as described in the Whitepaper below. The only way to receive back their NFT is by paying a "ransom" plus a small premium back to the smart contract. This creates a system where each NFT has a liquid value attached to it redeemable at any time. Since many many people will claim their tokens and never retrieve back their NFT, the Titan Legends collection will become hyper deflationary over time. Additionally, there is a 3% burn of the $LGNDX token on each "claim bounty" or "pay ransom" transaction, making the $LGNDX token deflationary as well.

TitanLegendsMarketplace.sol Overview:
The NFT Marketplace is the first marketplace where users are able to buy and sell Titan Legends NFTS natively in the $TITANX token. Since the NFTs were originally minted using the $TITANX token, it will allow users to keep transactions within the exosystem, adding to the utility of TitanX. Per each transaction, there is a 3% marketplace fee in $TITANX that is directed towards the DragonX vault, removing $TITANX from circulation.

DragonX Vault Contract Address: 0x96a5399d07896f757bd4c6ef56461f58db951862
