Titan Legends // $LGNDX - NFT/Token Hybrid

Titan Legends introduces a novel NFT // TOKEN Hybrid model through an innovative two-way escrow mechanism which solves the problem of liquidity in the NFT space. This innovative mechanism allows users to lock their Titan Legends NFTs in exchange for LegendX ($LGNDX) tokens and vice versa, successfully blending generative art NFTs with the liquidity of an ERC-20 token. This not only creates a hyper-deflationary NFT collection, but also supports deflation in the $LGNDX token as users interact with the system.
