Titan Legends // $LGNDX - NFT/Token Hybrid

Titan Legends introduces a novel NFT // TOKEN Hybrid model on Ethereum and within the TitanX ecosystem through an innovative two-way escrow mechanism which solves the problem of liquidity in the NFT space. This innovative mechanism allows users to lock their Titan Legends NFTs in exchange for LegendX ($LGNDX) tokens and vice versa, successfully blending generative art NFTs with the liquidity of an ERC-20 token. This not only creates a hyper-deflationary NFT collection, but also supports deflation in the $LGNDX token as users interact with the system. 

LGNDX Token Overview:

2,888,888,888 TOTAL SUPPLY

$LGNDX/$TITANX Initial LP

0/0 TAX TOKEN

TitanLegendsBattlefield.sol Overview:

The "Battlefield" is the escrow/staking contract for Titan Legends NFTs and $LGNDX token. Users have the option to lock their NFT in the smart contract and claim a "bounty" of a set amount of $LGNDX tokens per a points system as described in the Whitepaper below. Users then have the option to pay the Bounty (puchase) any NFT out of the Battlefield at ANY time. This creates a system where each NFT has a liquid value attached to it redeemable whenever the user chooses to. Additionally, there is a 3% burn of the $LGNDX token on each "claim bounty" or "pay ransom" transaction, making the $LGNDX token deflationary as well.

TitanLegendsMarketplace.sol Overview:

The NFT Marketplace is the first marketplace where users are able to buy and sell Titan Legends NFTS natively in the $TITANX token. Since the NFTs were originally minted using the $TITANX token, it will allow users to keep transactions within the exosystem, adding to the utility of TitanX. Per each transaction, there is a 3% marketplace fee in $TITANX that will remove $TITANX from circulation.
